# LeetCode - 75 questions study plan

## Concepts Overview

### Algorithm
A set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
- Clearly defined problem statement with input and output;
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order;
- The steps also need to be distinct;
- The algorithm should produce a result;
- The algorithm should finish in a finite amount of time.

### Algorithmic Thinking
Breakes down a problem into steps identiyfing what data structure is best for the task.

### Time Complexity
Way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of input increases.

How long it takes to complete a task.

### Space Complexity
It deals with the amount of memory taken up on the computer.

### Big-O Notation
Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.

It means the order of magnitude of complexity.

"Upper bounds" because it measures how the algorithm performs in the worst case scenario.
